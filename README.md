Savings Group Web App 💰
Welcome to the Savings Group Web App — a simple, yet powerful tool to help students pool their savings into a collective fund for investment. This app simulates a group savings scenario where students can choose different savings tiers, track their interest, and manage their membership with ease.

Whether you're looking to create a savings plan with your friends or just want to see how a savings pool would work, this app gives you the flexibility and features you need to get started.

Features 🚀
Student Registration:
Students can register by entering their name and selecting a savings tier. Once registered, their weekly interest and total withdrawal amount will be displayed.

Savings Dashboard:
View the total amount saved by all members in real-time, with a detailed breakdown of each student's contribution, accumulated interest, and total withdrawal amount.

Tier Validation:
Each student can select from three tiers with set amounts:

Tier 1: ₦10,000 (5% weekly interest)

Tier 2: ₦20,000 (10% weekly interest)

Tier 3: ₦30,000 (20% weekly interest)
The app ensures the right amount is selected for each tier.

Withdrawal & Membership Management:
Students can withdraw their savings, which removes them from the group, updates the total savings, and allows new students to join in their place.

Real-Time Updates:
The app dynamically updates the total savings and student list as new members join, and existing members withdraw their funds.

Modern & Responsive Design:
The app is designed with a clean and user-friendly interface, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

Tech Stack 🛠️
React.js for building the frontend.

TypeScript for type safety and better development experience.

CSS for styling (no frameworks, just pure CSS for a smooth experience).

How to Use 📝

View Savings:

Withdraw:
If you want to withdraw your savings, simply click the "Withdraw" button, and you'll be removed from the group, with your total funds updated.
